# Reproducible scRNA-Seq Analysis

This repository is a template for how to build a reproducible pipeline for scRNA-seq analysis using Snakemake and conda. As an example, we will execute the [Seurat tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc3k_tutorial.html) for scRNA-seq.

## Set up

You must have conda installed.

### Create conda virtual environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
